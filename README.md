# CubeJump3D-Game

This is a unity 3D game project. 
 Backstory:
   Meet the main character Doofus, a cube that loves exploring green platforms called Pulpits. The
   catch? Pulpits don't last long and disappear within seconds. Doofus has set a challenge to walk
   on at least 50 Pulpits.
 Characters/Props:
   1. Doofus: The main character (a simple cube will work too).
   2. Pulpit: A green metallic 9x9 platform where Doofus walks.
Goal:
   Guide Doofus to walk on as many Pulpits as possible. Be cautious! If Doofus walks off the edge,
   he falls and the game ends.
Challenges:
   Each Pulpit has a timer. When it runs out, the Pulpit is destroyed, and Doofus falls.
